"We wake up every single day determined to change the world by delivering a great Bitcoin exchange. Bitcoin is more than just a new way to make purchases. It's even more than a protocol for exchanging value over the internet without an intermediary. We are empowering people to live simply, efficiently and more connected to others. We put our clients' best interests first and foremost. They are at the heart of our company and drive everything we do. We believe in having a laser focus when pursuing our strategic goals and participate only in markets where we can make a significant contribution. We quickly grasp new ideas and concepts with confidence. We are in constant pursuit of innovation and strive to consistently exceed expectations. We believe in complete transparency, deep collaboration and we never forget that people come first. Having this mindset allows us to grow and advance at a rate that others cannot."
