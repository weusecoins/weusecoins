<p><img src="/images/airbitz-paul-puey.png" alt="Paul Puey" style="float: right; margin-bottom: 20px;" />Paul is a proud Electrical Engineering and Computer Science graduate of UC Berkeley with a wide range of technical skills from low-level 3D graphics engineering to development of custom web CMS systems, even before people knew what a CMS was. He held lead engineering positions with Nvidia and Chromatic Research, but most recently owned and operated several non-technical small businesses throughout California. There he learned the importance of the intersection of people, business, and technology. Today, he aims to bring Bitcoin mainstream with software and products aimed at simplifying Bitcoin and making it insanely easy to send and secure this revolutionary currency while maintaining the highest level of privacy. When not converting people to bitcoin you’ll likely find him climbing a rock in Joshua Tree or at a local climbing gym.</p>

He transitioned from Analog to Digital Signal Processing and has worked in the Defense Industry before turning to Digital Mobile. Working at Bell Labs, he architected the world's first commercially available GSM chipset, earning him a Distinguished MTS. After a year as Bluetooth Architecture Review Board chair in 2001 for Agere Systems, he moved on to higher layers in the protocol stack and eventually ended up contracting for Android development, spanning the lower layers through advanced UI. When Airbitz needed to integrate their C code of core bitcoin libraries into Android, he jumped at that challenge and now iOS and Android enjoy the same core codebase and UI look and feel. This is his first adventure in crypto coins. In his off time, Thomas enjoys lifelong learning, sailing, and San Diego.</p>
