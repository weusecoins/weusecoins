<title>Getting Started with Bitcoin - We Use Coins</title>
<meta name="description" content="What is Bitcoin? Get started with Bitcoin right. Learn how to buy bitcoins, use the best bitcoin wallets and find the best bitcoin exchanges.">

<h2><b>Step 1</b> ---> Get a Bitcoin wallet</h2>

There are many Bitcoin wallets to choose from with various levels of security, convenience and complexity.
<p>A great path would be <b>(1)</b> a mobile wallet like Airbitz (iPhone, Android), Breadwallet (iPhone) or Andreas Bitcoin Wallet (Android), <b>(2)</b> acquire bitcoins from a friend, as payment for a good or service or buy bitcoins from Circle and then <b>(3)</b> if you decide to store large amounts of bitcoins and want to know they are absolutely safe then use Armory.</p>
<p><h3>Mobile Phone Bitcoin Wallets</h3>
There are iPhone and Android apps available. Two popular choices are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://airbitz.co">Airbitz</a> (Android, iPhone)</li>
<li><a href="http://breadwallet.com/">Breadwallet</a> (iPhone)</li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet&hl=en">Andreas Bitcoin Wallet</a> (Android)</li>
</ul>
<p><h3>Bitcoin Software Wallets</h3>
Software wallets are downloaded and run from your computer.  They are considered more secure because the user has more control and does not depend on a 3rd party service.  Most software wallets require nearly a full day or longer constructing a local copy of the blockchain before use.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bitcoin.org/en/download">BitcoinQT</a> - The original Satoshi wallet from bitcoin.org</li>
<li><a href="https://bitcoinarmory.com/">Armory</a> - (Highly Recommended) Armory is the most mature, secure and full featured Bitcoin wallet but it can be technologically intimidating for users. Whether you are an individual storing $1,000 or institution storing $1,000,000,000 this is the most secure option available. Users are in complete control of the generation and storage of all Bitcoin private keys.</li>
</ul>
<p><h3>Bitcoin Web Wallets</h3>
Web wallets are the easiest and most convenient to use but are potentially less secure than wallet software run on your own computer.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.circle.com/signup">Circle</a></li>
</ul> 
<p><h3>Bitcoin Hardware Wallets</h3>
Hardware wallets are the most secure because they don't expose your private keys to the network.</p>
