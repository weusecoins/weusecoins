<h2 id="how-to-get-a-bitcoin-wallet"><b>Step 1</b> ---> How to get a Bitcoin wallet</h2>

<p>Setting up your first Bitcoin wallet is simple with several quality mobile apps available. If you want to do thorough research then you can read our comprehensive guide on <a href="/en/find-the-best-bitcoin-wallet/">how to find the best Bitcoin wallet</a>.</p>
<p>A great path would be <b>(1)</b> a mobile wallet like Airbitz (iPhone, Android), Breadwallet (iPhone) or Mycelium (Android), <b>(2)</b> acquire bitcoins from a friend, as payment for a good or service or buy bitcoins from Circle and then <b>(3)</b> if you decide to store large amounts of bitcoins and want to know they are absolutely safe then use Armory.</p>
<p><h3>Best Mobile Bitcoin Wallets</h3>
<p>iPhone and Android apps are available with popular choices including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://airbitz.co">Airbitz</a> (Android and iPhone)</li>
<li><a href="http://breadwallet.com/">Breadwallet</a> (iPhone)</li>
<li><a href="https://copay.io/">CoPay</a> (Everything - Awesome mobile HD multi-sig wallet!)</li>
</ul>
<p><h3 id="best-bitcoin-wallets">Best Bitcoin Software Wallets</h3>
<p>Bitcoin software wallets are downloaded to your computer, give you more control and do not depend on third-party services. Most software bitcoin wallets require a day or so to download the blockchain before they are ready for use.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bitcoin.org/en/download">Bitcoin Core</a> - The best option for network security.</li>
<li><a href="https://bitcoinarmory.com/">Armory</a> - (Highly Recommended) Armory is the most mature, secure and full featured Bitcoin wallet but it can be technologically intimidating for users. Whether you are an individual storing $1,000 or institution storing $1,000,000,000 this is the most secure option available. Users are in complete control all Bitcoin private keys and can setup a secure offline-signing process in Armory.</li>
</ul>
<p><h3>Best Hybrid Bitcoin Wallets</h3>
<p>Hybrid Bitcoin allow you to both control the private keys and have the easy of use of a web wallet.</p>
<li><a href="https://coinkite.com">Coinkite</a> (Web and Offline HD multi-sig wallet)</li>
<li><a href="https://copay.io/">CoPay</a> (All Platforms)</li>
<p><h3>Best Bitcoin Web Wallets</h3>
<p>Bitcoin web wallets are the easiest and most convenient to use but are potentially less secure than the above options because the private keys to your bitcoins are usually held by a third-party.
<p>Do to the large number of security breaches where people have lost bitcoins therefore we do not recommend any of the current Bitcoin web wallets.
<p><h3>Best Bitcoin Hardware Wallets</h3>
<p>Bitcoin hardware wallets are the most secure because they do not expose your private keys to the network.</p>

<p>All images have transparent corners.
