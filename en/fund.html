title: Funding - Bitcoin Marketing Fund - We Use Coins
---
<h1>Bitcoin Marketing Fund</h1>
<p>WeUseCoins is exclusively financed by donations from the Bitcoin community. This is the official information page on the Bitcoin Marketing Fund, a fund set up mostly using the bounty we won with the &quot;What is Bitcoin?&quot; video.</p>
<h1>Loss of Bitcoins</h1>
<p>In July 2011, the wallet holding the remainder of the WeUseCoins marketing fund was lost. Despite triple backups we were unable to recover the private keys. Wallet security at the time was very much an unsolved problem and there were several cases of four or even five digits sums lost or stolen.</p>
<p>In our case we protected very heavily against theft, by using a virtual machine to host the primary copy, and a Truecrypt encrypted copy on Dropbox as well as a copy on an Ironkey as backups. The complexity of that setup ended up working against us as none of the backups were actually accessible when we needed them.</p>
<p>The lost coins are still viewable in the block chain <a href="http://blockchain.info/address/1AYLzYN7SGu5FQLBTADBzqKm4b6Udt6Bw6">here</a> (6511.96 BTC) and <a href="http://blockchain.info/address/17eSZivDJpuJp9TxezTXVxkgLbsr3XZM1i">here</a> (491.25 BTC).</p>

<h1>Future Plans</h1>
<p>With the loss of most of our funding we currently don't have any concrete plans to make more videos or run major campaigns. But we will continue to work on the website and help Bitcoin in any way we can.</p>
