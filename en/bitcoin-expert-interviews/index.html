<p>When the <a href="/en/bitcoin-price/">Bitcoin price</a> goes up and Bitcoin becomes more popular then more charlatans and schemers come out of the woodwork purporting to be bitcoin experts. Sifting the noise to hone in on the signal of an experienced, trustworthy, knowledgeable and credible bitcoin expert can be incredibly difficult.
