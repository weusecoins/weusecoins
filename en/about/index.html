<h3>History</h3>
<p>We Use Coins started in 2010 when the <a href="/en/bitcoin-price/">Bitcoin price</a> was around $0.25 with a small team from the Bitcoin community focused on making an animated short film explaining Bitcoin. Almost a hundred people provided their input in the form of feedback, recommendations and ideas. Bitcoin developers Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn reviewed the final script draft for technical accuracy. After the video was publish on March 22, 2011 with bitcoins trading around $0.75 there were 9,052 BTC paid out in the spirit of covering expenses associated with creating the video. Sadly, significant amounts of bitcoins were lost or more work could have been done.</p>
<p>The treasurer was very heavily protected against theft. The Bitcoin wallet was primarily hosted on a virtual machine with backup copies on a Truecrypt encrypted copy was stored on Dropbox and in an <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/ironkey">ultra-secure Ironkey</a>. The complexity of that setup ended up working against us as none of the backups were actually accessible when we needed them. Unfortunately, the <a href="http://www.bitcoinarmory.com">Armory</a> Bitcoin wallet did not exist or that would have been used and the bitcoins would most likely still be safe.</p>
<p>The lost coins are still viewable in the block chain <a href="http://blockchain.info/address/1AYLzYN7SGu5FQLBTADBzqKm4b6Udt6Bw6">here</a> (6,511.96 BTC or currently about $1,660,000)) and <a href="http://blockchain.info/address/17eSZivDJpuJp9TxezTXVxkgLbsr3XZM1i">here</a> (491.25 BTC or currently about $125,000).</p>
