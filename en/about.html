<h1>About WUC</h1>
<p>WeUseCoins is a website dedicated to making Bitcoin more accessible to beginners. It's currently managed by Bitcoin developer Stefan Thomas with the help of many other individuals from the Bitcoin community.</p>
<h1>Our listings</h1>
<p>Most changes to the website start with an email to <a href="mailto:info@weusecoins.com">info@weusecoins.com</a>. For businesses who want to get listed we sometimes require verification (typically because the business intends to hold consumers' money) and we reject any listing where there are doubt about the legality, longevity, usability or any other aspect of the business. That said, our resources are limited, so we obviously cannot make any guarantees about the sites we list.</p>
<h1>History</h1>
<p>WeUseCoins started in 2010 when Bitcoin community members <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=697.0">pooled their money</a> to put up a bounty for anyone who could make an animated short firm explaining Bitcoin. A small team consisting of Fabian RÃ¼hle, Chris Rice, Christian Barth and Stefan Thomas created the WeUseCoins video and website, but almost a hundred people provided their input in the form of feedback, recommendations and ideas. The final draft of the script was reviewed by Bitcoin developers Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn for technical accuracy. After the video went online, a bounty of 9052 BTC (about 7000 USD at the time) was paid out and went towards covering the expenses for the video as well as a <a href="fund">short-lived marketing fund</a>.</p>
