## Accept Bitcoin with BitPay

BitPay’s merchant processing charges a flat 1% per transaction. Payments are settled in fiat currency at the end of each day or week. Because Bitcoin payments are global, using BitPay allows merchants to accept digital payments from customers around the globe. 

## No Chargebacks

Bitcoin payments are irreversible, which means accepting Bitcoin with BitPay is like accepting cash. There is no risk of chargebacks, credit card fraud, or scams.

*	**Bitcore, API, and Insight.** BitPay’s [Bitcore](https://bitcore.io/), [API](https://bitpay.com/api), and [Insight](https://insight.is/) are open source tools that are free for anyone to use. 

## Why use BitPay?

As a merchant, Bitcoin’s volatility makes it hard to accept payments. A store would lose $10 if it receives $100 worth of bitcoin, and the Bitcoin price drops 10% before the store cashes out. 

In early 2011, BitPay was founded in order to tackle Bitcoin’s volatility problem for merchants. BitPay is a Bitcoin payment processor that helps merchants accept Bitcoin payments without having to worry about price swings: 

1.	A merchant integrates BitPay with their online store and can now accept Bitcoin.
2.	For each payment, BitPay receives the bitcoin and locks in the dollar value for the merchant.
3.	At the end of each day or week, BitPay sends a wire transfer to the merchant equal to the fiat value of payments received. 

This process allows merchants to accept Bitcoin without a Bitcoin wallet or any Bitcoin knowledge.
